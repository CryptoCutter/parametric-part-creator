# parametric-part-creator
A web-based tool to design and export custom 3D-printable parts for repairs and DIY projects.  Skip complex CAD softwareâ€”simply select a part type (like a roller wheel or clip), adjust its dimensions using sliders with a live 3D preview, and export the model as an STL file for your 3D printer.
